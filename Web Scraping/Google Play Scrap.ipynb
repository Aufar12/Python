      "1Useless app. Do not expect any refund despite their assurances that the refund will be credited in 2 weeks. My booking id is fbms3482 and case id are 22644557 & 23238622 dt 16.11.19. You want time to check your own computerised records. All details are given in this post. More than 10 weeks and stll no refund. .Mr sandeep kumar of oyo on 17/02/20 assured that refund will be creditef in 3 days, but stll no refund. Do the needful please.\n",
      "2Deceptive pricing. Multiple problems. Booked in for a 7 night stay for a total of RM289 with discounts. Post payment, they asked for another RM61 in the app! I have no idea why. Queried with the Malaysian branch \"Our price is dynamic and it was determined at the time of booking itself\" Thanks Ezad Syafiq from customer relations! In short, not their problem the app showed me one price during booking and asking for more money after!\n",
      "3I wish there was an option to give 0 stars to this useless service!! They say my refund has been processed but the amount hasn't been credited to my account. They just keep on saying that they have initiated the refund on their end!!! Better to directly contact the hotel for booking rather than using this service and if you still wish to use this service, please please (and I cannot insist this enough), do not make online payment, because that just means losing your money in case you cancel!!\n",
      "4I have an problem with my book, when i get a book for the nights and i looked into upcoming book, i dont get into my detail booking. Im always got errors. I dont know how to cancel it, because of it. It always said \"something went wrong! Retry\". Im looked into my email account to cancel it, it say click here. I click but nothing happened, its just back, right away into apps and error again. Bad experience at all.\n",
      "5I had the worst experience with this app they made a fool out of me, I for the first time booked a hotel, made the payment also, then they reassigned me to some other place, so I cancelled it. Then made another booking which when I reached the property was not at all the same as the pictures suggested , the time were stinky and very cramped. So I had to leave the place. But it shows that I checked in and also checked out. Plus they never refunded my money. Never ever oyo again. Not reliable.\n",
      "6This app is helpful and the customer service too. Customer agent Sajis helped me a lot when i was in a problematic situation.\n",
      "7The hotel booking through this app was the worst experience as the hotel didn't allowed me to checkin, when I asked for reason they simple said that we won't allow pre-paid customers. To solve this issue I checked the app but it don't have a proper query management system. The app don't provide any sort of SOS mechanism. And as the hotel don't allow you checkin, they don't any proper refund policy. One word of advice for all who are about to book hotel through this app.. PLEASE DON'T Book.\n",
      "8Such a cheap customer service.. have tie up with cheap hotels... Re-shifted my booking to somother hotel in the last min and atlas i was waitin outside the hotel with my family for more than a hour and customer service was sooo cheap... Better avoid this cheap app... Not worthy for the money... They don't care for their customers... Booking( BQGX6430 ) Escalated\n",
      "9This app sucks. It doesn't show hotels in the exact place we search instead shows hotels miles and miles away. Gps search is not functioning properly. The rooms shown are far away from the search location. Very very worst app ever. Fed up of this app. I feel its better to book rooms in person. I would never suggest this app to anyone. Literally disappointing and annoying.\n",
      "10Worst experience i ever had is that though it was shown a confirmed booking, on reaching the hotel the receptionist informed as that there was no room vacant. When i told him it is showing a confirmed booking in the app he replied that it might be some network error, you have no room here. Me along with my family was wandering in Tirupur that night. Though i lodged a complaint in the OYO help desk it was of no use\n",
      "11The 1 star rating is for the lousy app, not OYO, which has some great deals. But the app is bad. Can't book with it at all because instead of showing us the booking home screen right away, it insists on showing \"looking for deals\" with a spinning wheel that goes on forever. If you have a slow connection, forget it. That spinning wheel page will never go away and you can't do anything with it because it is forced on you. So I still use agoda even when booking oyo properties.\n",
      "12Most cheating app ever, they cheat people in every possible way. I had some horrible experience with oyo, with booking, with payment, with staying. In one case, I cancelled booking (hotel denied my booking and asked to cancel) and still waiting for refund. I konw i'll never get this. If u want to have safe sex without any hesitation with extramarital affair and pre Marriage gf or paid woman, u can choose oyo hotel which are very very dirty and below average room\n",
      "13I did a prepaid booking for a hotel in Gangtok. Booking amount debited from my bank account and got booking confirmation in email, SMS, whatsapp message. But when visited for check in, hotel owner did not accept OYO booking and told they will not allow OYO users. I immediately dialled OYO customer support, but they did nothing but processing of refund. Me with my family get harashed on that day for OYO.\n",
      "14This could be better. Please add dedicated customer service from the application, not just from booking. And those options on the \"need help\" section doesn't help anything at all. I hope it will get better anytime soon.\n",
      "15Don't book hotel on this app, never give your refund, and don't ever trust the managers of the hotel, because they will lie only My booking id is STIC9023..... I got a call regarding the refund and they said it will take 17 to 18 days, but it's been 1month now and I still didn't receive my refund\n",
      "16The oyo money is a joke unless you want to travel to India. Cannot be used in the states. Just use the rewards apps for the hotels. That is how you get.free rooms without imposing on friends and family. The app is difficult to use and it makes it hard to communicate when they dont understand the app theyre working with. Even a 5 year old could structure better.\n",
      "17The most irritating platform I've ever gone through...this platfrom is so distrust that it took my extra amount of 820/- INR and yet not paying me back...while I was even said by the concern team that I will be paid back...it's been since January 2020 that I'm not getting my amount back..they r giving me several excuses about the refund is not done..the most doubted platform...don't ever trust this platform..next time I'll never ever do any kind of booking from this platform..the worst platform\n",
      "18Picture rooms cannot load, what's wrong, my connection good\n",
      "19Worst app there is no option to delete my info.. I don't want to use this app so, I'm trying to delete but there is no option to delete how could google keep types of account where a user can't erase there details permanently. This app forced us to keep our info every thing i had put in this app my mobile number my email address... If i dont want this app any more why there no options foe delete my account\n",
      "20After online payment I found tremendous difficulty during my check in. Some of the hotels refused me because I have paid online. The receptionist in those hotels informed me that they are not getting any money from oyo company for long time. I advice you all, never pay online. Otherwise the app is good.\n",
      "21Worst app ever. When We reached to their Hotel, We found that Hotel or Guest Room was closed & we had to cancel our booking but, did not get the refund even after 2 days. Also, their customer service is not helpful & whenever I ask them about refund & their policy about it, they just say that they have no idea & they just handle booking query & not REFUND problem which by the way is part of Booking. I suggest you to look for others application & BOOK your room through them.\n",
      "22Worst experience and there is no safety at all The oyo person comes and opens the ventilator window and seeing in to the room No water in the bathrooms recording with cameras in the room.no neatness hotel oyo 65107 and my booking id JDBW5402\n"

      "24I love the concept but irritates me when it doesnt show on your own currency. I am a first time cx just downloaded the app to see how it works. But when you are trying to book to a different place or outside your country it doesnt convert on your own currency. Pls fix.\n",
      "25The quality is degrading day by day. Even financial transactions are very poor. Never opt for advance payment, it may get stuck and then you will never get back. The customer care will be of no help. This has happened to me, and since then I have stopped booking on this app.\n",
      "26This issue is quite regular at OYOs nowadays. I've online prepaid the full booking amount, and then the reception staff says, SORRY SIR, we can't give you the room.. room is not available at this rate.. we have a room costing higher amount, if you want, you can pay upfront and have that room... we'll cancel your booking through Oyo.. and so the amount will be refunded to you, you pay in cash to us.. they say OYO is owing a huge sum (amounting to several lakhs) to them, and so that's why they are\n",
      "27This app is degrading day by day.. You book hotels and hotels deny the booking. I don't understand what kind of service they are providing. Every single time we have to face such situations. Waiting at the hotel then going to another one. Uninstalling this app. And will recommend not to trust this app any more.\n",
      "28Had a very bad experience. It was my wedding in January 2020 and had booked 4 rooms for my guests about 3 months back with full payment in advance. The service apartment shut down we were not notified about this. When me and guests reached the apartment, it was an embarrassing situation as nobody was there to assist. Ultimately we had to place guests at an alternative accommodation. I hate OYO and will never use this third grade unreliable app. Booking ID AEGI0325, HQIL0723, SZMH9135\n",
      "29We get Notification like \" Congratulations you got coupon code for next stay\" when i click this it should open notification panel and should give details regarding that coupon and then u can give a option to book from there\" But at present when i click on notification its going to Booking page. As user we want to know the offer details to decide whether this offer useful or not. If u make this change there is higher chance of booking. Thanks you for the response.\n",
      "30Till now I have booked 2 times with oyo.But one the major problem is that the pictures shown in the app different to the reality. As 1st time when I booked a room and made pre-paid payment but at 9 o clock in the morning when I contacted with your customers care they said this hotel do not accept pre-paid booking.Second time I booked a another hotel which shown in the app that it has ac but in reality there were none in my room As a indian customer I urge you to enable 6 hours stay. Pls cut rate\n",

Update : No resolution provided on booking id DFVT6193.Same is the case with booking id XBFP8270\n",
      "32Waiting for OTP. Ya ya ya, not even able to log in. There was no OTP sent at all, use whatsapp log in and also same. Nothing happen. Since Im not even able to log in actually if possible I would give 0 star. Since u ask my contact, I have sent you an email. Let see how you manage to fix the problem\n",
      "33Booking id - CEJS6378, I tried booking this hotel, the payment got failed 1 time and it was successful another time. The failed amount is still not refunded back to me. It's been more than 2 months. Whenever I am calling customer care they are just escalating my issue and still I am waiting for payment. Refund my amount or else I will sue you for â‚¹802 only.\n",
      "34The one thing I am most satisfied with is that Oyo always solves the problem created by the local hotel owners....I stayed at a hotel of Oyo and the local manager of the hotel mentioned it as no show for which I would be charged with RS 53 extra on my next booking that means according to him I never stayed at the hotel,but the guest experience manager Shivam_9002 immediately escalated the matter and my problem is solved .also I am happy that I won't be charged extra for my next stay at oyo ðŸ™‚\n",
      "35Extend the discount expire date to june could be nice because right now,there is a virus so we could not go holiday plus book some hotel,so basically more income coming for you if you extend the expire date until the virus done. Think about it how much will you get when people go holiday and get discount on your app after the corona virus.\n",
      "36this is my first time using Voice app and everything with this I was very happy with what's going on but they also need to elaborate on some of these motels because some of these motels require extra cash deposit when you get here this one that I'm booking tonight is a little extreme for their cash booking but I already confirmed of my book end so I'm doing it this one time but he needs to collaborate on if there's additional charges before check-in the motel\n",
      "37Worst app. Not worth for even 1 star. I downloaded this app and now not able to login. It says \"no internet connection\" though I am connected to WiFi. Uninstalled and again downloaded but problem still not resolved. :/\n",
      "38Be very careful with OYO. I had a worst experience. I booked AC room in Sri Rangaa Pilgrim Place, Srirangam, TN, India. Photos in the App are different and actually it is a very mean, third class hotel. I can exhibit photos. AC, TV are only ornamental - don't work. No hot water, no Shower. Room is a dirty dungeon. DONT BOOK on OYO, DON'T ADVANCE PAY. It's my earnest advice.\n",
      "39If you are an international traveller then dont install this app. This is only for Indian hotels. If you search any country name then you get hotels in india only. FAKE INFO provided. User cant search hotels in specified country (no option to choose country IN THE APP). App showing Only predefined hotel name only. There is no filter or list of hotels in the other countries. Useless. Only indian hotels. Worst app. This app showing Indian hotels only. ðŸ‘Ž There is no option to change country.\n",
      "40Tried Oyo app again and it's a misery. I booked a hotel by mistake and upon cancelling it, i was not refunded. Took to Oyo ping who simply couldn't help. Representative on the phone could not even understand the issue properly and kept on summarising. I even asked the representative to shift the booking by one day as the dates were wrong and still oyo can't help. Even the cancellation charge quoted on app was wrong as there was refund. No refund upon cancelling. Faulty app. Booking id BLPZ1892\n",
      "41Lets see. First they take two days to answer thru facebook. When you do get someone to answer they send push statements stating to check the app. Well duh, i was asking an unrelated question. Then if they cant answer your chat they tell you to call. So theres 2 days wasted there. Second is there vouchers sold thru shopee. I bought 4 of them thinking i could save money. Well it turns out when you use the coupon, you pay more then you would without the coupon. Oyo is grown too big too fast. Awful!\n",
      "42The oyo is becoming too worst. Even 1 star rating is also very high. Don't book any rooms from this app. they were playing with our time and money. I have booked 3 rooms in a hotel and paid money but when reached to that hotel the manger did not provided any room and when I called the oyo customer care they do didn't responded and took 7 hours time and made me stand on road\n",
      "43Worst of all. It's been 2 days im facing the same issue of prepaid booking and denial of room by the hotel stating that OYO doesn't give them money. I tried to lodge a complaint but nobody is picking my call and the option of OYO captain is no more visible in the app. OYO must resolve the issue ASAP or just turn down their business. Today i lost 633 rupees since i booked a day slot due to my flight in the evening but they didn't allow me to check-in. Even yesterday i had to face the same.\n",
      "44Very annoying... 1. Not confirms ....the date ...entered 2. Date area should be highlighted... not gray.... or Default with red boundary.... After confirmation...it should turn green... 3. Thay are dedicated to their business...but disturb a lot... 4. No much use of wallet points...\n"

If we call to oyo they will put our call to hold more 1 hr no response worst app,fake app\n",
      "46Do not install this app. It's useless. I booked a month before our trip because It's peak season but got a text form OYO saying that I cancelled my booking. What the heck?! I expected that everything's okay and settled but you're going to cancel my booking?\n",
      "47Go for other platforms which provides same service, oyo service is good until you do a check in.Check in is also automatically done sometime s.After checkin the customer service is worse.You cant cancel. Customer service team will put you on hold with no answers. Hotel management is unhappy with oyo. They charge 100+% of price offered at hotel. My suggestion book through oyo.call hotel reception ask for a better deal in cash and cancel booking in oyo.\n",
      "48Pathetic service. No support from oyo. False promises. Not going to use oyo again. Checked in and found room is not what I booked. Had to literally fight to get what I booked. Then a new problem, ac is not working. After hours or heated argument finally got ac working. Oyo wasn't not supportive at all. They don't even pickup the call or call you back.. Guys don't use oyo. They are scamsters. No work ethics. Also 5 star reviews are paid reviews\n",
      "49Its doing great by providing good services n showing all hotels in just a screen that would make travel easy n it's soo wide that we can book hotel at our ideal place...staff was also friendly and so the customer service.. thanks for making stays at reasonable price...however it is down nowadays still happy with the serviceðŸ˜Š\n",
      "50This is a 3rd class Hotel App...I have booked Oyo 42839 Aram Hotel on 7th & 8th March...Hotel rooms are not as seen in the photo & even the ammenities are not as described while booking..Not even a phone in a room for room service........Do not pay on Oyo App even if it is giving you a huge discount before checking the Rooms...\n",
      "51Excellent app for Booking on cheap prices...easy to use with many payments options..clean rooms..but peoples books 24hr pay for 24hr and stay only for 5-6hr as per their needs.. Try to make 2 to 6hr stays options and as per customer requirement timing it will save little money for users.. it will be more useful for people's even good for OYO\n",
      "52Changed my phone number and now I can't use Oyo at all because the app won't let me log in saying there are multiple login attempts from different accounts, doesn't work regardless of how many times I delete cache and storage or re install the app\n",
      "53I used to love this app but some of the hotels are so filthy and there are some which you may feel are in red light areas and some can't be found on the maps. And if you ask for refund they don't even bother to pay half the amount.\n",
      "54Don't believe them ever and be very very careful when you are making online payments. Will trick you efficiently and skin money from your account. I was warned by various hotels associated but I didn't pay any heed and now I learned it the hard way. So I would say, just be extra careful\n",
      "55Overall good expirences.. But food is very expensive .. Pls add more budget hotels.. Some time hotel price is very high as per hotels standered ..\n",
      "56Worst service,no proper customer support. Once you pay before booking and if you not like room than you have no receive customer support ,they only available on chat but not enough to see our problem.even no calling support they give us.in night we have no option to search other near place at saturday night and we adjust whatever worst service they give us even they not provide room which they show in image but we adjust because we are with our mom dad and they are senior citizens worst service\n",
      "57Worst experience ever. Never ever book any rooms from this app. Their cudtomer care dont have any proper link with the hotel and they give half information on the app about the hotel. When u try to call them they put you on hold for 20+ minutes and then never reply. Worst service ever.\n",
      "58False descritption of the hotel. My checking has been denied at 11 PM midnight..this is regarding oyo 15119 vista service apartment. Now the app is not showing this booking anywhere so I can raise the complain. Just dont book this oyo...you will suffer definitely. Booking id : FGJA1287\n",

      "61Not a reliable app. Faced issue twice on same day. Hotels listed and booked through app and even by customer care executiv denied checki and mentioned they discontinued the agreement with OYO . When asked from customer care of OYO to provide some resolution they simply said they can't do anything in this case. As per OYO customer care, user needs to double check with hotel before checkin . If I have to check and call the hotel. I will directly book the hotel rather than using an interface.\n",
      "62Hilarious app. In the app it says \"pay to book\" for some good hotels, no option to book and pay at hotel. There is no booking without payment and the hotel reception didn't accept online payments and tells to pay again in cash.\n",
      "63Its completely a fraud platform.Never use this app..i need to cancel my booking(id:ZWYF5817) on 20 /11/2019 as the oyo didnt pay the hotel.Its been 3 months still it is not refunded i lost the money (Rs1361).so never done online payment .Not at all recommended.\n",
      "64Worst App & Service ! I booked a Oyo hotel by paying online at the time of booking and when I went for the check in, the guy at reception didn't allowed me to check in and told the reason that if you have done online payment then we won't approve your room as the price in which you've done the booking is not feasible for us. So, here's my question to Oyo is that why are you showing those hotels in search results which are not following your procedure & regulations ?\n",
      "65I booked a hotel. After a while I received an sms stating 25% off on booking amount if paid before check-in. I paid. Upon arrival at the hotel, the hotel admin told me that they do not accept online booking or payment, and had conveyed the same to Oyo. Booking got cancelled. I was counting on Oyo, and had very little time left for a conference. Oyo's CS executive apologized & processed refund. But the level and intensity of inconvenience I faced can't be refunded.

Its seems tht this is just a trick and all lies.\n",

Unknown error try later ........ Uninstalling and will try it some other time when your app is glitch free\n",
      "70The app is good however the quality of hotels neees to be given a denovo look. What has happened is that people who had normal rooms to be given on hire with substandard facilities have come on board the oyo platform. They are offering rooms at low prices but are not able to maintAin basic hygiene and cleanliness. The staff at most of these places is highly untrained.\n"

They don't care for their customers anymore and you will finally uninstall this damn app. Better don't wait for all this to happen to you and uninstall it this very moment.\n",
      "83Saved at least $25 each time I used the app. Hotels not in every part of the usa though.\n",
      "84Very problematic with every stay. Starting from booking,refund,stay and with rules which are not mentioned in policies and rules. Highly disappointing.better to use goibibo or mmt.\n",
      "85Nice booking experience and comfortable stay , but its request to oYo that kindly update your hotels so that we can find it easily . Sometimes some hotels are discontinued with OYO but they are still showing on your app. So see into this .Our convinience should be your priority.\n",
      "86Horrible experience My booking ID is XZBW4318 in Anakapalle. It was a prepaid1939/- And I was pre intimated oyo that I will come at 3:00 a.m. morning so please inform the hotel, when I was gone at the hotel at 3:30 a.m. hotel was told to me they have no room left, hotel was 5 km away from the city and there is no any other hotel near about that location and also no any transport service wasn't available at morning 3:30 a.m Therefore I was come at the City by walking. And OYO said that just Sorry\n",
      "87booking id VQJK8501 .. Worst experience now, used to be better. Never pay online, pay at hotel is better option so that u are saved from hassle... The hotel denied me check-in for paid booking and then asked to pay in cash. oyo didn't refund even after lot of promise. Their new standby song is good but that is all the relevant piece u will hear while talking to them ..terenve terah teneranve terah ko kuch nahi aata .. gaana sunakar phone kaat dete hain..\n",
      "88They are totally fraud & unethical professionals.we are in profession where we use to travell frequently.Now i am going to uninstall this app forever. I made a booking through customer care directly,he asked me to make online payment,I did it and then when I call hotel receptions they are saying we are closed,kindly ask oyo to refund your amount. When I called oyo they said sir neither we can't give you any other option for stay nor we can give you refund amount.\n",
      "89I can't login by clicking \"continue with whatsapp\" nor using my phone number. The former always take me back to the home page, while the latter would not send me any otp code. Please fix this.\n",
      "90Dear Oyo Most of the hotels are denying to give room if we are making payments on your app . Resolve this issue and then give offer on prepaid payments. Stop fooling peoples..I am a regular Traveller and now Oyo hotels are becoming headache slowly.\n",
      "91Haven't seen such unprofessional behavior from any company/app. I had my booking on 2nd march(the property was closed for 3 months and yet oyo app is enlisting it)... they haven't removed it yet. I couldn't checked in and they haven't given me refund... it's been a month and got knows how long it will take. One of the worse experiences ever. Don't trust oyo. Would have given zero star if I possible.\n",
      "92the rooms are spacious,very cheap and most importantly the room so clean like a 4 stars hotel.\n",
      "931. Opened Oyo app.. searched for rooms in Goa, booked and paid.. email, whatsapp and message confirmation received.. booking confirmed... 2. Just one week before the vacation, you guys call and have the temerity to tell me that the booking has to be cancelled due to some unexplainable reasons and all you have to offer as a replaced is some 3 star rated rooms.. you just lost a customer.. booking Id AWNY6931.. Update: Escalation team followed up and resolved the issue..\n",
      "94The worst app ever they are only interested in giving rooms to couple on hourly basis..they first confirmed the booking later after reaching the property they canceled it and shifted it to new property after reaching the new property property owner said no rooms are available and since then oyo is not attending any call. They are just another brothel service. One star is more than they deserve.\n",
      "95This app is easy to use and Akash is a very good communicator, I booked room many times through oyo and i must say it is very good for finding a room in better price.\n",
      "96Most useful apps ... But I calling some oyo reception like gantok sikkhim etc and they persons said per night charge rate is much high .... Than why you share the details for per night on oyo apps ...... Please consult for better service for all ....\n",
      "97Pathetic! Hotel red fort jaipur.. just before booking the room i confirmed it by the oyo customer care about the swiming pool facility whether it's complementary or not! The Oyo personnel told me that on my booking on selected dates I'll get complementary swimming pool access.. but on reaching the hotel i was told that I'll have to pay rs 400 extra in order to get access for swimming pool with the rude behavior of the staff!\n",
      "98I am using this app from long time . but now this new update is showing only paynow option in application there is no other mode like pay on hotel . This is the worst update of this app since i m using this app .\n"

      "99Worst App. I have booked a room in kolkata with two times money deduction for a single deal from my bank account. After arriving with tiredness, the hotel authority refuse to check me in. When i called oyo and told the difficulties, they told me to go another hotel. I have to manage expenses and got harassment also. I booked a deluxe room and got ordinary room. Insult, harrasment, tiredness, double deduction of amount, hot talk with their customer care executive are free gifts given by OYO.\n",
      "100Thanks oyo .its very useful app all photos are original which shows in pic gallery. Booking process are very easy. Cancellation option are also very comfortable.\n"
